This is my first post! I had a great time configuring this project to be able to write this post!

If you're curious on how I build this project, you can take a look into my [Github Profile](https://github.com/migpalg)!

## Technology stack

I used some popular technologies to build this site:

- NextJS: A React framework to build websites.
  - I used this framework due it has a lot of flexibility to build things
- MDX
  - I used MDX instead of markdown for its ease for configuration and custom components. I can inject custom components into the markdown and make the site look neat!
  - I'm panning to add some callout components in the future.
