First time I deployed this blog I ran into some issues. After setting up some
terraform code to deploy a static Next.js app to S3 and CloudFront and did my
first deployment, I went directly to the cloudfront URL and everything seems to
be working just fine! But when I tried to reload the page in a different route different
from the home page, I got this error:

```xml
<Error>
  <Code>AccessDenied</Code>
  <Message>Access Denied</Message>
  <RequestId>...</RequestId>
  <HostId>...</HostId>
</Error>
```

I almost cried. I thought I had done something wrong with the terraform code, but
after some debugging I found out that the problem was how CloudFront works:

1. When you deploy a static Next.js app, the app is built and the static files are
   generated in the `out` directory.
2. When you deploy the app to S3, the files are uploaded to a bucket.
3. When you access the app through CloudFront, it tries to fetch the files from
   the S3 bucket.
4. If you access the app through the root URL, CloudFront fetches the `index.html`
   file from the S3 bucket and everything works fine.
5. If you access the app through a different route, CloudFront tries to fetch the
   file from the S3 bucket, but it doesn't exist. For example, if you access
   `https://example.com/about`, CloudFront tries to fetch `about` (without any extension)
   from the S3 bucket, but it doesn't exist. This is because Next.js uses client-side
   routing and the files are generated in the `out` directory.

## How to fix it

To fix this, and not leverage on client-side routing (Fallback to `index.html`),
we need to add an AWS CloudFront function to rewrite the URL and point to the
generated `.html` file.

This is the function that I used:

```js
function handler(event) {
  var request = event.request;
  var uri = request.uri;

  // If the URI doesn't end with a file extension and doesn't end with a slash
  if (!uri.includes(".") && !uri.endsWith("/")) {
    // Append .html to the URI
    request.uri = uri + ".html";
  }
  // If it ends with a slash, remove it and add .html extension
  else if (uri.endsWith("/") && uri !== "/") {
    request.uri = uri.slice(0, -1) + ".html";
  }

  return request;
}
```

You can add this function to your CloudFront distribution using the AWS console, AWS CLI,
or Terraform. If you want to add it using Terraform, you can use the following resource:

```hcl
resource "aws_cloudfront_function" "rewrite_uri" {
  name    = "rewrite-uri"
  runtime = "cloudfront-js-1.0"
  comment = "Rewrite URLs to append .html when needed"
  publish = true
  code    = <<-EOT
function handler(event) {
    var request = event.request;
    var uri = request.uri;

    // If the URI doesn't end with a file extension and doesn't end with a slash
    if (!uri.includes('.') && !uri.endsWith('/')) {
        // Append .html to the URI
        request.uri = uri + '.html';
    }
    // If it ends with a slash, remove it and append .html
    else if (uri.endsWith('/') && uri !== '/') {
      request.uri = uri.slice(0, -1) + '.html';
    }

    return request;
}
EOT
}
```

Then you'll be able to deploy and access your static Next.js routes without any issues
and without using client-side routing.

## Why not use client-side routing?

Using client-side routing will limit the SEO capabilities of your app. If you want
to have a static site that is SEO friendly, you need to use server-side rendering or
static site generation. This is because search engines need to be able to crawl
your site and index the pages. If you use client-side routing, the search engines
won't be able to see the pages and won't be able to index them. This will result
in a lower ranking in search results and less traffic to your site.
